# NSAIDs-Project
#  This project in ML is coded in Python and is used to identify usage pattern of the consumption of NSAIDs (Non-steriodal Antiinflammatory Drugs)
# It uses Supervised Learning for Prediction and classification of people self medicating based on a given number of factors.
# Unsupervised Learning to Identify hidden patterns and trends in NSAID consumption.

The following algorithms are used for Supervised Learning which are mainly - Random forest,  Logistic Regression, Decision Trees  
The following algorithms are used for Unsupervised Learning which are mainly - K-Means clustering
